If you want a plain website without all of this
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)/[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
business, you just need to fill the repository with plain html and css
and avoid directory names that start with underscores.

I recommend using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
though. Markdown is just so much nicer than html, to write and
maintain.
