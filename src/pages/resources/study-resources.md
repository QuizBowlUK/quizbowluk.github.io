[**Packet Archive**](http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com): This is one of the key resources --- a website with thousands of quizbowl packets of all kinds stretching back years. It’s important to keep tabs on their difficulty --- it contains things all the way from American middle-school questions (fairly quick and easy) up to extremely difficult open tournaments with horrendously obscure answerlines, as well as a number of specialist subject packets. If you would like suggestions for academic tournaments to start out with, try _British Novice_, _ACF Fall_, or _ACF Winter_ for something more difficult. <!--Navigating all of these links without prior knowledge is a bit daunting, but if you would like some suggestions for tournaments to start out with, try these: [2017 Early Fall Tournament](http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/2048/), [2017 ACF Fall](http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/2040/), [2018 PACE](http://quizbowlpackets.com/2155/).-->

One can also find so-called "trash" packets on the archive --- these are packets with a non-academic focus, including pop culture, sport and memes. Many are one-off packets written for fun, but there have been some tournaments in this vein, such as [_ACRONYM_](https://trash.quizbowlpackets.com/2774/) or the [2016 _Lowbrow Oxford Open_](https://trash.quizbowlpackets.com/1807/).

<!--One can also download "trash"---pop culture---packets, which tend to be of wildly varying quality, but are often good fun. Most of these are American but you might want to have a look at [Lowbrow Oxford Open 2015](http://trash.quizbowlpackets.com/1679/).

[**QuizDB**](http://www.quizdb.org): This is essentially a database of loads of individual quizbowl questions, categorised by tournament, difficulty, category and subcategory. For instance, say you want to read some easy ‘college-level’ questions about sculpture, or some challenging questions about chemistry --- just click the relevant sections of the drop-down menus and you can read through to your heart’s content.

This site is also useful when writing questions, either to check what difficulty levels an answer has been asked at, or to find clues for tossups (doing this excessively is somewhat frowned upon, however).-->

[**QBreader**](https://www.qbreader.org/): This is a website that you can use for practising quizbowl questions on your own. It also serves as a database, allowing you to look up questions by category and tournament difficulty. This comes in especially useful when writing questions, as a sanity check for difficulty.
NAQT You Gotta Know: NAQT is an American company which produces a lot of quizbowl questions. One of the best features on their website are these short guides which go through and explain lists of topics which come up frequently in quizbowl tournaments.
