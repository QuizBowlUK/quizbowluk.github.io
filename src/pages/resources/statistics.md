[**HSQuizbowl Stats**](http://hsquizbowl.org/db/): After almost all tournaments, the stats from the day will be posted on this site. The main results page will give the main leaderboard of the teams, though in other sections one can view an individual player’s performance or broken-down details for a whole team. Some of the numbers can be a bit difficult to get one’s head around – the key individual one is usually said to be PPG, or ‘(average) points per game’, counting only tossups. As a team, the ‘PPB’, or ‘(average) points per bonus’, is often the most highly regarded. Of course, worrying about this kind of thing is really nowhere near necessary.

**Buzzpoints**: Buzzpoints are usually released on a per-tournament basis to players and other people relevant to the tournament. They show where each player buzzed on each question, which bonus parts each team answered correctly, and other per-team and per-category statistics.

[**College Quizbowl Stats**](https://quizbowlstats.com/): A website developed by [Ryan Rosenberg](https://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/Ryan_Rosenberg) that hosts compiled quizbowl statistics, including buzzpoint data.

[**HDWhite**](http://hdwhite.org/qb/stats/): This is a tool which allows you to search through the database of stats to find results for particular names of teams.
