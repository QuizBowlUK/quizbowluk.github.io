[**UK Quizbowl**](https://discord.gg/GY2RnCE): this is a casual server with past and present quizbowl players from the UK and elsewhere. Quizbowl packets are read out on Monday evenings.

**UK Quiz**: this server is intended for all current university students in the UK who are interested in quizbowl. You can discuss tournaments here and practice online with students from other universities, but there's also room for chatting about things like _University Challenge_ or _Only Connect_. You will need to confirm your status as a student to join. To join the server, either contact your university's quiz society for the invite link or [contact us directly](/contact).

[**US Quizbowl**](https://discord.gg/quizbowl): its size might make it a bit intimidating, but the American quizbowl discord server is good for general chatting about quizbowl and tournaments, and occasionally a packet might be read out on there.
