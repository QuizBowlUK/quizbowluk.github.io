[**HSQuizbowl Forums**](http://hsquizbowl.org/db/): This is the main internet forum for quizbowl. It’s a little bizarre, and dominated by Americans, but there’s nevertheless a lot of useful stuff on there. For instance, the ‘best of the best’ forum section includes guides on improving as a player, on writing better-quality questions, and all kinds of advice that you never realised you needed... it is, however, extremely liable to devolve into inscrutable in-jokes.
