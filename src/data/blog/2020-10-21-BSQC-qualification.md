Due to increasing demand over the last few years, to play in the 2021 British Student Quiz Championships (BSQC), teams must now qualify. The result will be a twenty-four team tournament.

A team qualifies if they meet one or more of the following criteria:

- <p style="font-size: 18px">They were in the top 4 at BSQC 2020;</p>
- <p style="font-size: 18px">They finish as one of the top 4 finishers who have not already qualified previously at a designated qualifier tournament (e.g., they finish 5<sup>th</sup> in an event in which the top four teams have already qualified) <span style="font-weight: bold">and</span> four teams from their institution have not already qualified;</p>
- <p style="font-size: 18px">They receive one of 4 wildcards from the BSQC committee.</p>

Teams affiliated with non-UK institutions may not qualify for BSQC directly, but may apply for a wildcard place. Wildcards will require an application and will be awarded partly on the basis of performances (PPG, PPB and finish places) at quizbowl tournaments throughout the 2020--21 season, as well as taking into account how new the institution is to quizbowl. Teams who have not attended a qualification event will not be awarded a place at BSQC unless in extraordinary circumstances. Roster changes between qualification tournaments and BSQC are permissible.

If a team is unable to attend, the organising committee will invite those teams who came fifth best of one or more of the qualification events, breaking any ties using difficulty-adjusted PPB.

The qualification events this term will be: [**IKEA Closed**](https://www.facebook.com/events/705334380098951/), which is being held on 24<sup>th</sup> October; and **ACF Winter** which is being held on 7<sup>th</sup> November. We will announce which events in next termâ€™s calendar will be qualification events, as well as more detail about BSQC itself in the coming months.
