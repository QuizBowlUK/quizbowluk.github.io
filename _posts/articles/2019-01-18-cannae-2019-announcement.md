The Edinburgh University Quiz Society together with UK Quizbowl will hold another novice quiz tournament, **Caledonian And Northern Novice At Edinburgh (CANNAE)**, on February 9<sup>th</sup>.

This tournament is specifically geared towards players with minimal previous exposure to competitive quizzing, and will be a great starting point for introducing new players. To be eligible for this tournament, players must *(1)* be in the first three (four in Scotland) years of a UK undergraduate degree and *(2)* have never averaged more than 30 points per game at a university-level quizbowl tournament. Players who do not meet either or both of these requirements can be admitted at the discretion of the organisers; please message the [EUQS Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/UoEQuizSoc/) if you require any further information.

The event will be held in Old College of the main campus of Edinburgh University. We are delighted to announce that the fee for taking part will be flat at just £20 per team.

The field cap for this tournament is eight teams and you can sign up via directly messaging the [EUQS Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/UoEQuizSoc/) or by emailing <contact@quizbowl.co.uk>.

Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions by any of the means provided above. More details will be provided in due course on the Facebook event linked at the top of this announcement.
