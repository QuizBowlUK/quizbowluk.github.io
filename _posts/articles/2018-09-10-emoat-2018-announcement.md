We are pleased to confirm that a mirror of the [Oxford Autumn Tournament (OAT)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-05-oat-2018-announcement %}) will be taking place in Edniburgh this October.

The **Edinburgh Mirror of the Oxford Autumn Tournament (EMOAT)** will be held on October 20<sup>th</sup>, the same day as OAT, with exact location within Edinburgh to be confirmed later. This is a great opportunity for universities from Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North of England to try out a quizbowl tournament without making a long trip to Oxford. Guidelines about question difficulty can be found in the [OAT announcement post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-05-oat-2018-announcement %}). We intend to accept 10 teams, with priority given to university teams, but the field could be expanded depending on interest. The fees will be the same as OAT: a base fee of £60 per team, with a £5 discount for providing a buzzer set, a £5 discount for travelling a long way, and a whopping £20 discount for teams composed solely of people who've never played in a quizbowl tournament before.

The registration form can be found here: **<https://goo.gl/forms/o7ZcOfx7aIPHJ6jm2>**.

More information is available on the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/827394727384647/). We look forward to seeing you in Edinburgh!
