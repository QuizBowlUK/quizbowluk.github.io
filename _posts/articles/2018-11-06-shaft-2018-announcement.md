In conjunction with UK Quizbowl, the University of Southampton will be hosting the UK mirror of the American tournament Sun God Invitational, retitled as **Southampton Hard Autumn Finale Tournament (SHAFT)**. The tournament will be held on the 24<sup>th</sup> of November at Highfield Campus in Southampton, and the field cap is a maximum of 18 teams. The tournament is **open** — anyone, student or not, can enter a team.

This tournament will be the final UK buzzer tournament held in 2018, and is aimed at players with some quizbowl experience. The difficulty is targeted as somewhere in between 2018's [Oxford Autumn Tournament (OAT)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-05-oat-2018-announcement %}) and [Cambridge Hard Autumn Tournament (CHAT)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-01-chat-2018-announcement %}), and is roughly aimed as equivalent to [Terrapin 2016](http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/1872/). The set will **not** be Briticised, and the question distribution can be found [here](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=20713).

There are no eligibility restrictions for this tournament. To enter a team, please fill in the form [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlYiGja55AxtRHp8jfGkQBHFXegnoqQRmZI_TdyiCqsuAYqA/viewform). The entry fee is £70 per team, with discounts as follows:
* <p style="font-size: 18px">£5 for bringing a fully-functional buzzer set;</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">£10 for bringing a moderator;</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">£10 for the whole team travelling more than 200 miles to get to Southampton.</p>
