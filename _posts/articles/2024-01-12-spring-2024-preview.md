The quizbowl schedule for the 2024 spring term has been confirmed. With seven tournaments at a range of different difficulties, we hope that there is something for everyone this season. We plan for all of these tournaments to be held in-person.

*January 27<sup>th</sup>* -- **ACF Regionals** ●●●.
The ACF Regionals tournament will be making its ninth appearance in the UK quizbowl calendar. This is the most difficult student-only tournament of the year, and is ideal for more experienced players. However, newer players who have performed well at medium-difficulty tournaments are also encouraged to take part. We can confirm that the tournament will be hosted at **Imperial College London**; check the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1404453893507333/) for more details.

This tournament requires teams with two or more experienced players (i.e. those who have played a non-novice tournament at university prior to September 2021) to submit a half-packet. For more information, please read the [announcement](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=27226) on the main quizbowl forums.

*February 3<sup>rd</sup>* -- **DMA** ●◖.
Similar to CREEK+ last term, DMA (Daniel Ma’s Academic) is intended to bridge the gap between novice and medium difficulties. This tournament would be accessible to both novices and intermediate players hoping to advance on to harder tournaments. This tournament will be hosted at the **University of Warwick**.

*February 17<sup>th</sup>* -- **Cambridge & Oxford Open Tournament (COOT)** ●●●.
Put together entirely by the quiz societies of Oxford and Cambridge, COOT has established itself as one of the main events of the quizbowl calendar. Being an open tournament, non-students are eligible to take part. Expect tough questions, an even tougher field, and more British content compared to your typical tournament. Further details about the set may be found on the quizbowl forums [here](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=26968).

*February 24<sup>th</sup>* -- **Winter Novice** ●.
This will be a smaller tournament organised by members of the north of England’s quiz circuit, using a Briticised version of NAQT’s Collegiate Novice set. It is planned to be held at King’s Manor in the University of York, and is aimed at players with minimal quizbowl experience.

*March 2<sup>nd</sup>* -- **British Student Quiz Championship (BSQC)** ●●●.
BSQC is the premier student-only tournament of the year, with 24 teams making their way to London for a chance at our trophy. This year’s BSQC will use a Briticised version of NAQT’s Sectional Collegiate Tournament.

As in previous years, teams must qualify to attend BSQC; for more information on this process, check the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/355705963849015/) for the qualifiers.

*March 9<sup>th</sup>* -- **WaShBowl** ●●.
The quiz societies of Warwick and Sheffield have been hard at work to produce WaShBowl, the UK’s first quizbowl tournament focusing entirely on pop culture -- film, TV, games, music, sport, you name it. The target difficulty is equivalent to medium difficulty academic tournaments. This is a closed tournament, but teams containing students from different universities are allowed to take part.

*March 16<sup>th</sup>* -- **ILLIAC** ●●.
We close the term with ILLIAC, a medium-difficulty academic tournament. We expect the difficulty to be similar to ACF Winter and last year’s MRNA II tournament, and therefore suitable for a wide range of players.
