Last weekend, Freya Whiteford, representing [Glasgow University Quiz Society](https://www.facebook.com/guquizsociety/) in her role as President, received a new set of buzzers from the UKQB Treasurer Daoud Jackson. This is the first time that UKQB has handed over a set of buzzers, which are a vital tool for practicing and playing quizbowl questions. GUQS, although relatively new to the UK quizbowl scene, have been a major force in driving the expansion of the game in Scotland and the North, and this new set of buzzers will see plenty of use not only in GUQS practices, but also in tournaments in Glasgow, Scotland and beyond. The new [Durham University Quiz Society](https://www.facebook.com/Durham-University-Quiz-Society-101806164515676/) are also set to receive a UKQB buzzer set very soon.

Helping new (and old) quiz societies establish themselves and grow is a key part of our mission at UKQB, and provision of buzzers is often a vital step for teams to get more deeply involved in quizbowl. If your society is interested in procuring buzzers, please get in touch with us, and we will be able to get you and your teams buzzers.
