As part of our commitment to safeguarding, UKQB events are run in accordance with the following code of conduct; the form for reporting any violations is available [**here**]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/misconduct/).

1. All players and moderators should treat other participants and staff at a UKQB tournament with respect.
2. All players and moderators should not engage in exclusionary behaviour, which includes, but is not limited to: 
* threats of violence;
* discriminatory jokes and language;
* ridiculing or insulting other participants; 
* unwelcome sexual attention. 
3. Players and moderators should not engage in harassment of other participants. In general, if someone asks a participant to stop something engaging in a particular behaviour, then they should stop.
4. Players and moderators should not drink alcohol while at any UKQB tournament. [^1]
5. Active players may not consult reference materials or make use of communication devices (such as phones or computers) during gameplay. Halftime, timeouts, and any post-game period during which protests are discussed and adjudicated are not considered "during gameplay". 
6. Any tournament official may find that player associated with a team during the tournament has committed misconduct. Misconduct includes disruptive behavior, unethical behavior, any violation of this code of conduct, or other unsporting conduct. Officials may interpret these categories broadly. Teams are responsible for the conduct of all persons associated with that team.
7. All instances of misconduct should be reported to the tournament director or one of the designated tournament welfare officers. UKQB events have a dedicated [**form**]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/misconduct/) so that individuals can take their concerns to the relevant authorities anonymously if they wish.
8. Instances of misconduct may result in sanctions to be determined by the tournament director. These sanctions include, but are not limited to, suspension of a participant from one or more matches, loss of game(s) for a team, score or adjustment, or expulsion of that participant an entire team from the tournament.
9. Unless the tournament director decides otherwise, other staff may not impose sanctions, except that a moderator must eject from a game any person found to have committed misconduct a second time during that game (i.e., a tournament director may give the staff greater powers to sanction than this minimum). 
10. Sanctions are not appealable.
