## Quizbowl questions

[**Packet Archive**](http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com): This is one of the key resources --- a website with thousands of quizbowl packets of all kinds stretching back years. It’s important to keep tabs on their difficulty --- it contains things all the way from American middle-school questions (fairly quick and easy) up to extremely difficult open tournaments with horrendously obscure answerlines, as well as a number of specialist subject packets. Check here <span style="color: red">[Link to section of website with difficulty guide]</span> to see which difficulties and tournaments might be suitable for you and your team.

One can also download ‘trash’ – pop culture – packets, which tend to be of wildly varying quality but are often good fun. 

[**QuizDB**](http://www.quizdb.org): This is essentially a database of loads of individual quizbowl questions, categorised by tournament, difficulty, category and subcategory. For instance, say you want to read some easy ‘college-level’ questions about sculpture, or some challenging questions about chemistry --- just click the relevant sections of the drop-down menus and you can read through to your heart’s content.

This site is also useful when writing questions, either to check what difficulty levels an answer has been asked at, or to find clues for tossups (doing this excessively is somewhat frowned upon, however). 

## Online quizbowl

[**Protobowl**](http://protobowl.com): Protobowl is the main site for playing multiplayer quizbowl online. There are a variety of rooms, ranging from middle-school questions up to specialist public rooms, in which one can play against quizzers worldwide in real time; alternatively, one can easily set up a private room, either in order to hone your skills individually or to play with, say, other members from your society.

## Social resources

[**HSQuizbowl Forums**](http://hsquizbowl.org/db/): This is the main internet forum for quizbowl. It’s a little bizarre, and dominated by Americans, but there’s nevertheless a lot of useful stuff on there. For instance, the ‘best of the best’ forum section includes guides on improving as a player, on writing better-quality questions, and all kinds of advice that you never realised you needed... it is, however, extremely liable to devolve into inscrutable in-jokes. 

## Statistics

[**HSQuizbowl Stats**](http://hsquizbowl.org/db/): After almost all tournaments, the stats from the day will be posted on this site. The main results page will give the main leaderboard of the teams, though in other sections one can view an individual player’s performance or broken-down details for a whole team. Some of the numbers can be a bit difficult to get one’s head around – the key individual one is usually said to be PPG, or ‘(average) points per game’, counting only tossups. As a team, the ‘PPB’, or ‘(average) points per bonus’, is often the most highly regarded. Of course, worrying about this kind of thing is really nowhere near necessary.
