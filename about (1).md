#### Statement of purpose

**UK Quizbowl** was founded in 2018 as the official governing body of the fast-growing game of quizbowl in the UK. Quizbowl has been around for a number of years in this country and has been rapidly increasing in popularity, partly as a result of the success of people who play quizbowl on the TV show *University Challenge*. There was clearly a need to set up an organisation to help increase participation further. Our main aims as an organisation are to increase the number of people playing quizbowl, ensure the safety and happiness of competitors, and foster diversity within the game.

We help run a series of quizbowl tournaments throughout the year, which are aimed at players ranging from complete novices to veterans who have been playing for years. More details can be found on the [events page](https://quizbowl.co.uk/events/).

UK Quizbowl is also very keen to help interested students start playing quizbowl for the first time. You will find a large amount of resources on this website, including links to past questions and advice on how to study by current top players. If you are interested in setting up a quiz society at your university but do not know where to start or just want to know more about upcoming tournaments, please feel free to email us at <contact@quizbowl.co.uk> or get in touch via the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/quizbowluk).

Although now retired from student quizbowl whilst completing a PhD in Chemistry at the University of Southampton and Diamond Light Source, he plays for the Nomads in the Quiz League of London, for the Mangoes in the Online Quiz League, and competes in various individual formats. He has served as the head editor of multiple UK tournaments, including Cambridge Open, MKULTRA and several iterations of British Novice.</p>
