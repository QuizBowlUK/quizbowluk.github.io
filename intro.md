The following is a very quick introduction to the game of quizbowl --- a type of buzzer quiz focussing on academic knowledge.

{% include toc.html %}

## The basics

Quizbowl is a quiz format played between two four-player teams using an electronic buzzer system and is often described as being "like *University Challenge*". Those who have watched *University Challenge* will be familiar with the format of starter questions for 10 points, which are played on the buzzer, and conferring between team members is forbidden. Bonus questions on *University Challenge* take the form of a set of three questions all themed around a central topic, which are each worth five points. Quizbowl adapts this format and changes the rules slightly.

Starter questions (or, colloquially, **tossups**) are still worth **10** points for a correct answer, with a penalty of five points being imposed for buzzing in prior to the end of the question and answering incorrectly (informally termed a "**neg**"). Incorrect answers given when the player has buzzed in *after* the end of the question incur no penalty. Tossups in quizbowl are usually longer than starters on *University Challenge*, with up to five or six lines of text as opposed to one or two lines.

A feature of some quizbowl tournaments is the "**power**", which aims to reward more knowledge of a subject. Players who buzz in with a correct answer before a certain point in the question (a mark in the text visible to the question reader but not to the players) will earn **15** points rather than 10. The idea is that more knowledge about a given answer is required to be able to get a power, so in turn more points are awarded.

Bonus questions in quizbowl are very similar to those in *University Challenge*, with the main difference being that each of the three bonus parts is worth **10** points, rather than 5. Conferring between team members is allowed, in contrast to tossups. Bonuses in quizbowl are themed around a different topic (and usually a different category altogether) than the preceding tossup question, which isn't always the case on University Challenge.

## Quizbowl and *University Challenge*

Quizbowl is a sibling of *University Challenge*: they both developed from an American radio and TV show called *College Bowl*, which began in the 50's. <span style="color: red">[link to history of Quizbowl here?]</span> *University Challenge* is focused on being an entertaining TV show, while quizbowl aims to produce the fairest possible competition between teams. Quizbowl players have an outstanding record of success on the show in recent years <span style="color: red">[link to UC page]</span>

## Topic distribution

Quizbowl matches consist of either 20 or 24 cycles of a tossup followed by a bonus set. The categories of the questions in each round, usually referred to as the "**packet**", follow a pre-arranged distribution. For a 20 question set, the tossups and bonuses would each follow a set of categories something like this:

* <p style="font-size: 18px">4: Literature (usually 1 British, 1 American, 1 European, 1 Rest of World/Other – covering different genres as well: novels, poetry, short stories etc.);</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">4: History (usually 1 British, 1 American, 1 European, 1 Rest of World/Other – within these archaeology, historiography, political, social, economic and other histories can come up);</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">4: Science (usually 1 Biology, 1 Chemistry, 1 Physics, 1 Other — including maths, computer science, geology, astrophysics, science history);</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">2: Fine Arts (1 Visual, 1 Auditory — visual includes painting, sculpture, photography etc; auditory covers classical music, opera, jazz etc. Media with elements of both, e.g. ballet, could appear in either category);</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">1: Religion;</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">1: Mythology;</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">1: Philosophy;</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">1: Social Science (encompasses psychology, anthropology, economics, linguistics, sociology and law among others);</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">1: Popular Culture;</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">1: Miscellaneous (any more of the above, or questions which cross between categories).</p>
 
[^1]: These are often collated all together in discussions as RMPSS.

The above list is not fixed: some tournaments reduce the amount of "academic" content in favour of more popular culture, some will have categories such as Geography or Current Events, and some smaller tournaments (known as side events, usually played after a main academic tournament) focus on a single subject. Recent side events played in the UK include a music tournament written using snippets of audio rather than written questions, a tournament all about food (both gourmet and fast food) and a tournament all about geography. <span style="color: red">Links here?</span>

## Sample questions

All the above is best illustrated with some examples, so here is a tossup and bonus set from a tournament held in 2017 that was designed to be accessible to new players.

#### Tossup

> <p style="font-size: 18px">
	<span style="font-weight: bold">This person’s power was only secured with victory at the battle of Val-es-Dunes. One of this person’s main advisors was their half-brother, Odo, and they later married Matilda of Flanders. This person’s eldest surviving son was Robert Curthose, who only succeeded in part of this person’s domains. This person launched the (*)</span> Harrying of the North and commissioned the Domesday Book after claiming the English throne following the death of Edward the Confessor. For ten points, name this English king who came to power after defeating Harold II at Hastings. </p>
> <p style="font-size: 18px">ANSWER: <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">William the Conqueror</span> (or <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">William I</span> of England or <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">William the Bastard</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">William II of Normandy</span>; prompt on “William”; do not accept or prompt on "William II")</p>  

The above example shows how quizbowl tossups are essentially a collection of facts about the "**answerline**", which ideally are arranged from most obscure to easiest. This arrangement of clues is "**pyramidality**", which aims to reward deeper knowledge with an earlier buzz. The mark **(\*)** is known as the **powermark** — i.e. buzzing in before the reader has begun the word “Harrying” with the correct answer will earn you 15 points rather than 10. There are also quite a few acceptable answers, since William the Conqueror was known by a lot of names.

An answer of "William II" alone would not be acceptable, since it would implicitly refer to William II of England, his son, — however, William the Conqueror was also William II of Normandy, hence the full title is acceptable.

Additionally, an answer of "William" is not specific enough, since there have so far been four King Williams of England, so the question reader is instructed to "**prompt**" the player answering to be more specific, upon which they could answer with any of the four underlined alternatives to be ruled correct.

#### Bonus

> <p style="font-size: 18px">For 10 points each — answer the following about art museums in Continental Europe: <br /> <br />
[10] This Madrid art gallery contains such works as <span style="font-weight: italic">The Garden of Earthly Delights</span> by Hieronymus Bosch and <span style="font-weight: italic">Las Meninas</span> by Diego Velazquez. <br />
ANSWER: Museo del <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Prado</span> <br /> <br />
[10] A glass pyramid designed by I. M. Pei can be found at this other art museum in Paris, which houses the <span style="font-weight: italic">Mona Lisa</span>. <br />
ANSWER: <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Louvre</span> Museum [or Musée du Louvre] <br /> <br />
[10] This other art gallery in Madrid, named for the wife of Juan Carlos I and dedicated to 20th century art, notably houses Picasso’s <span style="font-weight: italic">Guernica</span>. <br />
ANSWER: Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Sofía</span> [or Museo Reina Sofía, or just The Sofía]</p>

A correct answer on the William the Conqueror tossup, then, would reward a team with this set of three bonus questions. A bonus set aims to contain an easy part, a medium part and a hard part (but not necessarily in that order). Here, the easy part is intended to be the Louvre (probably the most famous art gallery in the world); the medium part the Prado (the biggest gallery in Madrid, and home to a number of internationally famous paintings); and the hard part is the Sofía (a modern art gallery in Madrid which is smaller and is probably less famous than the Prado, but still contains some very famous paintings).
 
Thousands of sample questions of varying difficulties are available on the [Quizbowl Packet Archive](http://www.quizbowlpackets.com). Higher level questions are available in the Collegiate section, but for beginners it’s usually best to try some in the High School section and move up a notch if preferred. Some packets especially designed for new players can be found [here](http://www.hsquizbowl.org/db/questionsets/search/?name=SCOP%20Novice&hs=1&archived=y).
