#### Statement of purpose

**UK Quizbowl** was set up in 2018 as the official governing body of the fast growing game of quizbowl in the UK. Quizbowl has been around for a number of years in this country and has been increasing in popularity, partly as a result of the success of people who play quizbowl on the TV show *University Challenge*. There was clearly a need to set up an organisation to help increase participation further. Our main aims as an organisation are to increase the number of people playing quizbowl, ensure the safety and happiness of competitors, and foster diversity within the game.  

We will help run a series of quizbowl tournament throughout the year, which are aimed at players ranging from complete novices to veterans who have been playing for years. More details can be found on the [events page](https://quizbowl.co.uk/events/). 

UK Quizbowl is also very keen to help interested students start playing quizbowl for the first time. You will find a large amount of resources on this website, including links to past questions and advice on how to study by current top players. If you are interested in setting up a quiz society at your university but do not know where to start or just want to know more about upcoming tournaments, please feel free to contact us at <contact@quizbowl.co.uk>. 

One thing to point out: UK Quizbowl is currently just starting out, so more material will be added to this website over the course of the 2018-2019 season, including detailed results and analysis of tournaments as they are played throughout the year. We are currently consulting on the important issues of safeguarding and diversity, and will update the website accordingly when we have policies in place in these two areas.

Besides this he occasionally does work towards an Ancient and Modern History degree at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, which has so far posed no impediment to him missing easy history questions both on and off screen.</p>

This will be his second proper year of quizzing, coming off the back of appearing as the captain of Imperial’s University Challenge team where he relished incorrectly interrupting on his specialisms. When not trying to understand differential geometry or quizzing, he can usually be found sporadically across campus, often playing the French horn or trying to conduct his orchestra.</p>
