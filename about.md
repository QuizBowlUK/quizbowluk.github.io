#### Statement of purpose

**UK Quizbowl** was set up in 2018 as the official governing body of the fast growing game of quizbowl in the UK. Quizbowl has been around for a number of years in this country and has been increasing in popularity, partly as a result of the success of people who play quizbowl on the TV show *University Challenge*. There was clearly a need to set up an organisation to help increase participation further. Our main aims as an organisation are to increase the number of people playing quizbowl, ensure the safety and happiness of competitors, and foster diversity within the game.  

We will help run a series of quizbowl tournament throughout the year, which are aimed at players ranging from complete novices to veterans who have been playing for years. More details can be found on the [events page](https://quizbowl.co.uk/events/). 

UK Quizbowl is also very keen to help interested students start playing quizbowl for the first time. You will find a large amount of resources on this website, including links to past questions and advice on how to study by current top players. If you are interested in setting up a quiz society at your university but do not know where to start or just want to know more about upcoming tournaments, please feel free to contact us at <contact@quizbowl.co.uk>. 

One thing to point out: UK Quizbowl is currently just starting out, so more material will be added to this website over the course of the 2018-2019 season, including detailed results and analysis of tournaments as they are played throughout the year. We are currently consulting on the important issues of safeguarding and diversity, and will update the website accordingly when we have policies in place in these two areas.

Although now retired from student quizbowl whilst completing a PhD in Chemistry at the University of Southampton and Diamond Light Source, he plays for the Nomads in the Quiz League of London and competes in various individual formats. He has served as the head editor of multiple UK tournaments, including Cambridge Open, MKULTRA and several iterations of British Novice.</p>

He has been playing quizbowl since he was a fresher, and has held various positions on the Cambridge University Quiz Society committee, including being an incumbent Co-President. When not quizzing or updating some spreadsheet somewhere, he is probably failing to take blood from a patient in his guise as a sixth-year medical student.</p>

She was part of the Balliol College, Oxford team who made the semi finals of <i>University Challenge</i> in the 2020–21 season and in the process became a 'noted science player'. She can be found convincing people that everything is actually classics and reading far too much Borges, as well as attending tournaments to try and buzz on literature.</p>

Outside of quiz, Boyang can often be found despairing at the abysmal performances of Arsenal F.C.</p>

Besides this he occasionally does work towards an Ancient and Modern History degree at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, a subject largely unrepresented in his actual buzzes.</p>

Alex now lurks at tournaments trying to get literature questions right; If you meet him, be sure to say hi and let him tell you why Rachmaninoff’s music is the high point of human achievement.</p>
