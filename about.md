#### Statement of purpose

**UK Quizbowl** was founded in 2018 as the official governing body of the fast-growing game of quizbowl in the UK. Quizbowl has been around for a number of years in this country and has been rapidly increasing in popularity, partly as a result of the success of people who play quizbowl on the TV show *University Challenge*, which shares many similarities in format. Our main aims as an organisation are to increase the number of people playing quizbowl, help quiz societies across the UK, ensure the safety and happiness of competitors, and foster diversity within the game. You can find more about the committee and what each of our roles entails below.

We help run a series of quizbowl tournaments throughout the year, which range from our housewritten British Novice set for new university players, to the national championships of BSQC, to several tournaments open to anyone in the UK, and more. More details can be found on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/quizbowluk), and we have several mailing lists on which we provide updates. Please get in touch with us if you would like to join these.

UK Quizbowl is also very keen to help interested students start playing quizbowl for the first time. You will find several resources on this website, including links to past questions and advice on how to study by current top players, and we also have a student discord and a UK-wide discord server. If you are interested in setting up a quiz society at your university but do not know where to start or just want to know more about upcoming tournaments, please feel free to email us at <contact@quizbowl.co.uk> or get in touch via the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/quizbowluk).

After a year out from studying, during which he managed the UK Quizbowl blog and did a bit of writing for various tournaments, he is now starting a PhD at Imperial in climate physics. Oscar's aims as president include getting more universities involved in quizbowl and encouraging more students to get into quiz writing. His non-quiz interests include classical guitar, the Russian Revolution, and playing old titles in the Total War series.</p>

This is despite her only involvement in a quiz society being a single term at Warwick, and despite routinely having to ask her teammates which events she actually attended that year, which is a level of memory recall truly unprecedented in the world of Competitive Memory Recalling.
            <br/><br/>
When not in a Zoom call trying to remember the order of the Chinese dynasties, Abbie can usually be found in her room listening to some arthouse band from the late 70s, drawing maps of her latest Civilization game, and pretending to be in the shower every time the job centre calls.
