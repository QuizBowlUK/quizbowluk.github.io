On behalf of the [new UK Quizbowl committee](https://quizbowl.co.uk/about/#committee), we would like to welcome to the new 2022–23 season, which we hope will be full of huge buzzes, shocking twists, memorable comebacks, a fair amount of surprising upsets, and most of all, great fun for all players, writers and moderators.

The first order of business is to announce the upcoming tournaments pencilled in for the autumn term, more information about each of which will be found on [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/quizbowluk) closer to the date of the respective event.

*October 15<sup>th</sup>* — **ACF Fall (Warwick)**. In accordance with recent UK quizbowl tradition, the first student-only event of the season will be ACF Fall, an easier tournament aimed primarily at less experienced teams. There will be eligibility qualifications in place to limit participation to novice players, and this tournament provides a particularly good opportunity for newer universities to take their first steps into the quizbowl scene.

*October 29<sup>th</sup>* — **Penn Bowl (Warwick)**. This is a harder tournament, similar in difficulty to ACF Regionals and the NASAT Open the previous month. More experienced quizzers may find the set more rewarding, but there are no limits on participation, and open teams may be involved too (this will be confirmed closer to the date).

*November 5<sup>th</sup>* — **ACF Winter (Oxford)**. This tournament, in its third year after being revived following a decade off, will be half-way in difficulty between ACF Fall and ACF Regionals. It is head edited by well-known British quizzer and UKQB ordinary committee member Joseph Krol, whose team have worked tirelessly to produce a set that should be both fun and accessible for a wide group of players. For experienced teams, it is important to note the packet submission deadlines for this tournament, which can be found [**here**](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=26240).

*November 26<sup>th</sup>* — **British Novice (Imperial)**. This easiest tournament of the term provides another excellent chance for newer teams and players to dip their toe into the quizbowl pond, and affords them the chance to prove their mettle up against similar opposition.
